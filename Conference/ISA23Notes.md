The Impact of Strategies and Tac cs in Resistance Events
========================================================

PhD project on the *informal* relationships between violent and violent groups
within protest movements (mixed methods) 

	- Interesting and ambitious PhD project
	- How exactly collect the quantitative data?
	- I like the hypothesis and idea, but am not yet convinced by the theory
		- More repressive environment -> more formal relations
		- Less repressive environment -> more informal relations
	- When are violent movements "beneficial" in a non-repressive
	  environment?
	  	- Is it more a case of *emotion* running high, combined with
		  small, violent, sections of the movement and police
		  repression/provocation

Military deployment during civil resistance

	- "Police were overwhelmed", or could it be more of a signal - "We will
	  not tolerate any more protest/this ends now!" (risky for the
	  government)
