The Impact of Strategies and Tac cs in Resistance Events
========================================================

*Finn Klebe* (University College London (UCL))
----------------------------------------------

PhD project on the *informal* relationships between violent and violent groups
within protest movements (mixed methods) 

	- Interesting and ambitious PhD project
	- How exactly collect the quantitative data?
	- I like the hypothesis and idea, but am not yet convinced by the theory
		- More repressive environment -> more formal relations
		- Less repressive environment -> more informal relations
	- When are violent movements "beneficial" in a non-repressive
	  environment?
	  	- Is it more a case of *emotion* running high, combined with
		  small, violent, sections of the movement and police
		  repression/provocation

Military deployment during civil resistance

	- "Police were overwhelmed", or could it be more of a signal - "We will
	  not tolerate any more protest/this ends now!" (risky for the
	  government)

Undermining the Backfire Effect: Violent Tactics in Nonviolent Campaigns

	- But why then, do groups still engage in violence (in overall
	  non-violent protests)?
	- You define it as organized and strategic, so how is it strategic, if
	  you find it to be counter productive?
		- Is it strategic or emotionally driven? Are they irrational?
		  Miscalculating? If so, when are the scenarios in which it
		  *does* work?
	- Mediation models?

non-digital repression in autocracies

The political logic of hunger strikes.

	- Novelty effect? (years since last hunger strike)
	- Cascading strikes, interesting dynamics
	- Regime type?
	- The importance of the profile of the striker?
	- Last resort? Age of movement/organization at the time of the strike

Responding to Democratic Backsliding
===================================

Mathew Cebul (United States Institute of Peace) & Johnathan

Evaluating the US democracy support against democratic erosion

	- Organizing political parties from movements to challenge existing
	  (percieved as corrupt or ineffectual), rather than NVA
	
Sebastian Hellmeier (WZB Berlin Social Science Center)
-----------------------------------------------------
	
	- Smart voting in Russia?
	- "The people" and "replacement theories"

When does anti-backsliding protest work?

	- Haggard & Kaufman, 2021?
	- Proactive anti-backsliding reforms? Providing additional institutional
	  mechanisms for citizens to remove elected/aspiring autocrats
	- "Extreme" is still a morally loaded word, but rule of the metropolis
	  is interesting and very much what happend for large part of the French
	  revolution, which was the key driver in democratizing Europe in the
	  first place.

Anna Meyerrose (Arizona State University)
-----------------------------------------

EU strengthens executive power and constrains the domestic policy space, paving
the way for backsliding

	- EU as a scapegoat/outside influence to rally against (Brexit style)
	- The "null-finding" in the Baltics: Could it just be a case of the
	  local Orban loosing the (potential close) elections? I.e. the 
	  mechanisms are present and working, but not activated due to "abusive"
	  executives have not obtained power. Have these countries had such
	  presidential candidates?

Rule of Law and Conflict Processses
===================================

HÃ¥vard Strand 
--------------

Education and violent crime (meta analysis), the relationship is less clear than
you would think. Plenty of null findings. Homicide rates are increasing
globally.
	
	- Is this rise primarily tied to drug cartels and such?

Sally Sharif (Simon Fraser University)
--------------------------------------

What drives violence in post conflict societies. Empowering civilians to protect
themselves is unrealistic.

	- Residual armed groups
	- Reintegration camps seem to work, but the pattern of post conflict
	  increas in homocide rates is only present in areas where the pre-peace
	  rates were also high. Something else is goining on as well.
	
Liana Eustacia Reyes
--------------------

Alignment of legal principles conditions wether peace agreements work.

	- Could this not be about political preferences (with accompanying
	  differences in rules/legal principles)
	- Selection issues with the data? "rebel groups are good at documenting
	  themselves"
	- If you do not have legal non-congruence, then you have no (or at least
	  less) reason to state them.

New Frontiers in the Study of the Early Modern Asian Interpolity Order
======================================================================

Yuan-Kang Wang (Western Michigan University)
--------------------------------------------

Historians caution against the use of the concept of "the tributary system". No
such coherent system and a western invention. Does not account for alternative
reginoal world orders like the Mongol or Tibetan. Qing world order encompassed
all three.

Relatively peaceful region and period? Overlooks China vs nomads as well as
internal conflicts (excluded by "definitional fiat", dismissed as nonstate
actors).

Chinese military compiled data on Chinese conflict!
