The Impact of Strategies and Tac cs in Resistance Events
========================================================

*Finn Klebe* (University College London (UCL))
----------------------------------------------

PhD project on the *informal* relationships between violent and violent groups
within protest movements (mixed methods) 

	- Interesting and ambitious PhD project
	- How exactly collect the quantitative data?
	- I like the hypothesis and idea, but am not yet convinced by the theory
		- More repressive environment -> more formal relations
		- Less repressive environment -> more informal relations
	- When are violent movements "beneficial" in a non-repressive
	  environment?
	  	- Is it more a case of *emotion* running high, combined with
		  small, violent, sections of the movement and police
		  repression/provocation

Military deployment during civil resistance

	- "Police were overwhelmed", or could it be more of a signal - "We will
	  not tolerate any more protest/this ends now!" (risky for the
	  government)

Undermining the Backfire Effect: Violent Tactics in Nonviolent Campaigns

	- But why then, do groups still engage in violence (in overall
	  non-violent protests)?
	- You define it as organized and strategic, so how is it strategic, if
	  you find it to be counter productive?
		- Is it strategic or emotionally driven? Are they irrational?
		  Miscalculating? If so, when are the scenarios in which it
		  *does* work?
	- Mediation models?

International linkages (engagement in global economy) and the use of digital and
non-digital repression in autocracies

Belen
-----

The political logic of hunger strikes.

	- Novelty effect? (years since last hunger strike)
	- Cascading strikes, interesting dynamics
	- Regime type?
	- The importance of the profile of the striker?
	- Last resort? Age of movement/organization at the time of the strike

Responding to Democratic Backsliding
===================================

Mathew Cebul (United States Institute of Peace) & Johnathan
----------------------------------------------------------

Evaluating the US democracy support against democratic erosion

	- Organizing political parties from movements to challenge existing
	  (percieved as corrupt or ineffectual), rather than NVA
	
Sebastian Hellmeier (WZB Berlin Social Science Center)
-----------------------------------------------------
	
	- Smart voting in Russia?
	- "The people" and "replacement theories"

Thea
----

When does anti-backsliding protest work?

	- Haggard & Kaufman, 2021?
	- Proactive anti-backsliding reforms? Providing additional institutional
	  mechanisms for citizens to remove elected/aspiring autocrats
	- "Extreme" is still a morally loaded word, but rule of the metropolis
	  is interesting and very much what happend for large part of the French
	  revolution, which was the key driver in democratizing Europe in the
	  first place.

Anna Meyerrose (Arizona State University)
-----------------------------------------

EU strengthens executive power and constrains the domestic policy space, paving
the way for backsliding

	- EU as a scapegoat/outside influence to rally against (Brexit style)
	- The "null-finding" in the Baltics: Could it just be a case of the
	  local Orban loosing the (potential close) elections? I.e. the 
	  mechanisms are present and working, but not activated due to "abusive"
	  executives have not obtained power. Have these countries had such
	  presidential candidates?

Rule of Law and Conflict Processses
===================================

HÃ¥vard Strand 
--------------

Education and violent crime (meta analysis), the relationship is less clear than
you would think. Plenty of null findings. Homicide rates are increasing
globally.
	
	- Is this rise primarily tied to drug cartels and such?

Sally Sharif (Simon Fraser University)
--------------------------------------

What drives violence in post conflict societies. Empowering civilians to protect
themselves is unrealistic.

	- Residual armed groups
	- Reintegration camps seem to work, but the pattern of post conflict
	  increas in homocide rates is only present in areas where the pre-peace
	  rates were also high. Something else is goining on as well.
	
Liana Eustacia Reyes
--------------------

Alignment of legal principles conditions wether peace agreements work.

	- Could this not be about political preferences (with accompanying
	  differences in rules/legal principles)
	- Selection issues with the data? "rebel groups are good at documenting
	  themselves"
	- If you do not have legal non-congruence, then you have no (or at least
	  less) reason to state them.

New Frontiers in the Study of the Early Modern Asian Interpolity Order
======================================================================

Yuan-Kang Wang (Western Michigan University)
--------------------------------------------

Historians caution against the use of the concept of "the tributary system". No
such coherent system and a western invention. Does not account for alternative
regional world orders like the Mongol or Tibetan. Qing world order encompassed
all three.

Relatively peaceful region and period? Overlooks China vs nomads as well as
internal conflicts (excluded by "definitional fiat", dismissed as nonstate
actors).

Chinese military compiled data on Chinese conflict!

Legacies and Conflict
=====================

Feedback
--------

From Scott Abramson:
	- Think of the mechanisms and find evidence for them (-)
	- Look at other measures of conflict as well (specifically onset) or
	  move more clearly to intensity, linking closer to theory
	- PCS areas at valuable (worth fighting over), But this does not add
	  thaat well to the no state + capital (?)
	- Try country fixed effects (knowing it incurs PTB)
	- Jack Paine and others paper on the non-randomness of African borders

	- Do I control for who inherits the state? NO, but I will try


Liana Eustacia Reyes (University of Pennsylvania)
-------------------------------------------------

Are rebel institutions a means to an end, or an end in itself? Certainly for
revolutionary rebels (religious or political). 

Formal legal institutions of rebels are formalized if the rebels win
(h1)

Rebel governance is a good indication of future rule.

	- Chinese (counter)example of land redistribution

Alex Avery (Washington University in St. Louis)
-----------------------------------------------

The long term effect of Habsburg rule on gender attitudes

Emphasises historical borders. 

Nationalism within Habsburg empire was more inclusive than German and Russian
nationalisms.

Supervisor David seems like someone to check out

Popular Support for Violence
============================

Aiden Millif (MIT)
------------------

Majoritarian violence, "lynchings" etc collective vigilantism

State capacity? Status threat? Strength of majoritarian organizations (Hindu
nationalist)! Vidhya Bharti schools and alumni

So, is it grassroots or organized?

Reported as spontaneous events, but also small groups looking for trouble.

	- If courts are not working, vigilantism seems more reasonable.

---

Cow vigilantism? Cow protection groups, target alleged cow smugglers

------

	- But what is the political motive? Unite Hindus.

Unruly politics
===============

Catherine Hirst (Australian National University)
-----------------------------------------------

Strategic acquiescence - when revolutionary movements self-sensor their goals
for international change to preempt counterrevolution/great power backlash.
Fewer great powers, means less chance of a great power to support/protect ->
less strategic acquiescence.

	- Is this just a case of the size/power of the revolutionary state?

Josh Allen (Georgia State University)
-------------------------------------

Collective memory -> political attitudes

	- The collective memory of holocaust in France, consisted? If you
	  remember it as "not so bad" vs more realistic (probably follows
	  right/left devide)

Charles
-------

Even distribution/many pre-colonial states/polity density -> early democratic 

	- Which capital in Nigeria?
	- International systems with and without a center
	- Why only West Africa? 

Potential network analysis.

Authoritarianism & Democratic Backsliding
=========================================

Moritz Schmoll (Mohammed VI Polytechnic University)
---------------------------------------------------

Predictive power of parliamentary violence. FISTS data set :)
Indication of democratic decline? Run up to civil conflict?
Predictor of change? Weak results.

Yilin Su 
---------
 
	- Do these laws target regular citizens/voters, or opposition figures
	  journalists and candidates? If the latter, is it a show for the
	  audience or a useful tool of selective law enforcement? 

	  	- If it is for show, why do opposition bend? Are they playing to
		  different audiences?

		- Parallell to false/coerced confessions? Or is it even more
		  than a parallell.

Fabio
-----

	- Is this a case of equilibrium of benefits of membership and number of
	  members?

Understanding the Role of Actors in Mass Mobilization and Protest
=================================================================

Anna-Lena & Roman Krtsch
------------------------

What is the effect of public figures being present at protest events? (in
autocracies)

	- Effects on the protests themselves or on the goals of the movement?
		- H1 increased "mobilization"
	- Repression on t0 or t+x?
	- Gender of the public figure

Increased visibility, "resonance" and legitimacy of protests	

Victoria
--------

Sudden weather crises trigger protest events in autocracies when they impact
areas inhabited by excluded ethnic groups.

	- I like your summary of a chaotic literature, and buy your theoretical
	  argument!
	- How to improve the selection matching? Two step Heckman correction?

Johnathan et al.
----------------

Survey experiment on the presence of women in protest. Getting past (some of) 
the endogeneity. How are they perceived? Shield against repression? "You put
women on the front line". 

	- What were the results on repression? Trigger for the success -> would
	  join cycle?
	- Repression perceived as less appropriate, or less likely?
