1. "Dead" states might be overly "tabloid", creating some confusion.

2. Add even more on defining "state".

3. Try a model with some sort of weights by how recent the states were. Some
sort of "half-life" weight.

4. Add even more on why we consider borders almost exogenous for most countries,
and ephasize that for the rest it should bias against our hypothesis (i.e. we 
follow a conservative approach of including "problematic" countries).

I get the feeling that this was Scott's main issue.

5. Can we go futher back?
