\begin{Box1}{Lessons Learned !}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item  \textit{Terrorism} and \textit{terror} are two separate phenomena, in which the latter is especially damaging to our social fabric.
\item \textit{Terrorism} and \textit{television news} both catalyze fear of terrorism, thereby indirectly decreasing social trust.
\item Fear predominantly destroys trust in \textit{more democratic} and, albeit to a weaker extent, less dangerous countries.
\end{itemize}
\end{Box1}

\begin{Box1}{Persistent Puzzles ?}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item  Why is the relation between fear of terrorism and social trust insignificant in less democratic and more dangerous countries? What happens in those countries severely suffering so-called terrorist violence?
\end{itemize}
\end{Box1}
