\begin{Box1}{Lessons Learned !}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Terrorism is to a small, but significant, extent related to out-group hostility and political conservatism but not, as often assumed, to robust rally-around-the-flag effects. Here, the effects are primarily driven by a rally-around President Bush effect.
\item This field of study is characterized by a fairly narrow focus on the impact of \textit{Islamic} terrorism, particularly within the \textit{United States and Israel}. Studies quantifying the relationship between extreme-right terrorism and attitudes or studies conducted in non-Western settings are almost non-existent. Yet, the review suggests that such studies result in significantly lower effect sizes.
\item This field of study is also characterized by additional \textit{methodological issues}, especially a lack of preregistered, adequately powered, and longitudinal research designs.
