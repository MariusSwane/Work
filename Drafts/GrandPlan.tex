\section{Main Paper on HSE's and conflict}
\subsection{Literature}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[$\square$] The State and violence. General theories.
		Along the lines of \citet{Pinker2012} and \citet{Tilly1990}.
		With increasing state penetration comes an increasing monopoly
		on violence \citep{Tilly1990} and with this, certain
		cultural/psycho-social effects that translate into a generally
		more peaceful citizenry.
	\item[$\square$] Internal organized (as opposed to communal) violence.

	\item[$\square$] How old institutions affect current institutions
		(formal and non-formal or networks). How old institutions were
		integrated into the new states. There is going to be endless
		variation on this, so I will need to find some illustrative
		examples. Emphasize that in the cases of formal integration and
		continued existence, these institutions will probably have
		\emph{some} effect on conflict because of their legacy and
		continued involvement in local (if not national) conditions. In
		addition, I should emphasize that even when no formal
		institutions survive, HSE's can still affect current politics
		and conflict. Use good illustrative examples to make these
		points. Could refer to some of the examples in the first paper
		to save some labor.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Theory}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[$\square$] As predicted by the literature.
	\item[$\square$] Old institutions represent a measure of "governing
		capacity" that has hitherto been modestly explored. The more
		historical state presence the more people are used to and accept
		state intervention. 

		The state monopoly on violence should also be more consolidated.
		The degree of consolidation would probably vary with the degree
		of continuity between the historical state and the present
		state, but it should be a positive relationship in both cases. 

		The more historical state presence, the more time the cultural or
		psycho-social effects that \citet{Pinker2012} hypothesize have
		to affect the people in the area.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hypothesis}
	\bigskip
	\hangindent = 3.5em
	\textit{H\textsubscript{1}: Grid cells with higher levels of historical
		state presence experience less conflict.
		}
	\bigskip 

\subsection{Variables}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[$\square$] Theoretical and/or methodological grounding.

	\item[$\square$] Finding measures (data).

	\item[$\square$] Incorporate with the Geo-ISD data.

	\item[$\square$] Geography
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[$\square$] "Ruggedness", mountains or elevation.

			Provides shelter for rebels and prevents "exit-options"
			for subjects, to the benefit of stationary bandits
			(states).

			What is more, ruggedness could affect (negatively) the
			chances that cartographers and (to a lesser extent)
			historians have place a state there.

		%\item[$\square$] Desert.

		\item[$\square$] Rivers.
			Provide natural boundaries useful for state building.
			Navigable rivers bind cities together (again useful for
			state building). Rivers could often be navigated by
			explorers, thus increasing the likelihood that maps
			include a state there.

		\item[$\square$] Jungle. Potentially some
			circumscription/limiting escape option effects, and
			certainly an impediment to Western explorers and
			surveyors.
	\end{itemize}

	\item[$\square$] Distance from X.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[$\square$] Capital. In many cases the old capitals became
			the new capitals, around which I expect relatively high
			levels of HSP (historical state presence). Capitals
			probably (source) experience more of some forms of
			violence (coups, violent protests, etc., and less of
			other forms (combat deaths).

		\item[$\square$] Coast. Helpful for trade and communication and
			this state building. Dramatically increases the odds of
			being discovered by Western explorers. Also increases
			the odds of early colonization. Increases odds of being
			involved in slave trading. Connection to conflict is
			less clear, but perhaps through \citet{Nunn2008} slave
			trade leads to lasting trust issues leads to
			conflict-mechanism.

		\item[$\square$] Europe. Institutional "spillover" could lead to
			increased chance of HSP. Ease of discovery (when
			distance to coast and desert is taken into account) is
			certainly affected. Proximity to Europe could be
			correlated with conflict due to increased likelihood of
			being a transit-country for drugs and/or people being
			smuggled into Europe across the Mediterranean, and
			potentially through increased exposure to European
			neo-colonial interests. 
	\end{itemize}

	\item[$\square$] Exposure to slave trade. Partially explained in the
		distance to coast variable. Can be measured directly for some
		countries at least using data from \citet{Nunn2008}. Can be
		related to statebuilding in costal regions, and potentially
		state "de-building" inland. To capture slaves you must have an
		army. As stated by \citet{Tilly1990} among others, an increasing
		army creates the need for a state. Someone must surely have
		written something about this for East Africa. Inland I believe
		the slave trade (capturing of slaves) primarily led to
		devastation and not the "Tillian", $conflict \rightarrow state
		\rightarrow conflict \rightarrow etc.$, but I will need some sources
		on this.

	\item[$\square$] Population. Madison project data for historical
		population. Correlates with current population which affects the
		likelihood of conflict events. Related to state building (and
		thus HSP) because states need a certain population to coalesce
		and an inclution criteria in the ISD.

	\item[$\square$] Disease prevalence (missionary mortality rate).

	\item[$\square$] Resources.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[$\square$] Gold.

		\item[$\square$] Silver.
			
		\item[$\square$] Copper.

		\item[$\square$] Iron.
	\end{itemize}

	\item[$\square$] Spatial interdependence.

	\item[$\square$] Past Conflict.

	\item[$\square$] Regional and country-fixed effects.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[$\square$] How the old maps were made.
	\item[$\square$] Compare old maps to new. Do they agree on the core
		areas?
	\item[$\square$] Benefits of the Geo-ISD.
	\item[$\square$] Drawbacks.
	\item[$\square$] Alternative measures.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[$\square$] Cross section to avoid post-treatment bias.
	\item[$\square$] Alternative models.
