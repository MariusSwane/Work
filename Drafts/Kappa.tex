\section{Introduction}

In North West Indonesia, 1976, GAM (Gerkan Aceh Merdeka: Free Aceh Movement)
declared the independence of the province of Aceh under the leadership of Hasan
di Tiro, a descendent of the last Sultan of the Aceh region. Initially the
movement consisted of the remnants of an old religious network, with its roots
in the old Sultanate and armed struggle against the Dutch. The resulting
conflict lasted until 2005 and resulted in an estimated 3,402 combat related
fatalities after 1989 \citep{Aspinall2009, Pettersson2018, Sundberg2013}.

In Ethiopia in 1975, the Dirge regime tried to arrest the Sultan of Aussa. However,
anticipating the move, the Sultan's son had already sent men to neighboring
Somalia to train in guerilla warfare \citep{Shehim1985}. The Sultan evaded
arrest and launched the Afar Liberation Front (ALF) organized around the men
trained in Somalia. The heavy handed response of the Ethiopian military left
over a thousand civilian casualties \citep{UCDPconflict363}.

In 1960, in the newly formed Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville) (current
Democratic Republic of the Congo) South Kasai declared unilaterally to have
seceded from the nascent Republic under the leadership of traditional chief
Albert Kalonji \citep{Nzongola2002}. He then preceded to have his father
declared the new Mulopwe, thus resurrecting the royal title of the Luba kingdom
(1585-1889). His father promptly abdicated, handing the title to Kalonji (now
styling himself Albert Ditunga, `homeland'). South Kasai fought for independence
for just over two years, provoking a campaign by the Congolese armed forces that
at the time was characterized by UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld as an act
of genocide \citep{Nzongola2002}.

There is no shortage of examples where previously independent states are
involved in outbreaks of organized violence. Yet, both in the media and in the
academic literature these examples are referred to as ethnic conflicts, and
surprisingly little attention has been given to their connection to past
statehood. On the other hand, there are also examples of old state institutions
working for peace, mediation and reconciliation. For example [that guy in
Burkina Faso]. [Another example of peace inducing]. The nascent academic
literature on organized violence and the legacies of past statehood reflects
these diverging sets of examples. While some, in line with the examples given
above, find a conflict inducing effect of past states \citep{Englebert2002,
Paine2019}, others argue that past experience of statehood provides experience
and institutions that are peace inducing \citep{Wig2016, Wig2018,
Depetris-Chauvin2016}. Yet, all but one of these articles conceptualize states
in terms of currently (politically relevant) ethnic groups and to what degree
these groups have connections to past states. This risk excluding states that
are not readily tied to a current politically relevant ethnic group. It further
risks discrediting experiences of statehood of groups who have lived as part of
states for hundreds of years, without being the dominant ethnic group.
Additionally, this literature has been almost exclusively limited to Africa. The
diverging conclusions in the literature could in part be a result of the paucity
of quantitative data on past statehood. The literature has been limited to using
either the Murdoch map, which codes `jurisdictional hierarchy' of ethnic
groups, or the State Antiquities Index, which measures country level experience
of statehood (including from foreign rule). In summary, there is a need for more
and better data, in order to answer the puzzle of whether there is a positive or
negative association between state histories and organized violence.
Potentially, both statements are true, but vary according to circumstances. In
which case, what determines when and where past statehood is conflict inducing
or peace inducing?

%\textbf{What do I do to address the problem/puzzle?}

How is organized violence shaped by the underlying topography of historical
statehood? This thesis seeks to answering this overarching research question,
adding to our general understanding of organized violence. While increasing the
general understanding of key concepts is a goal in itself for any academic
discipline, this understanding will hopefully contribute to the vital goals of
conflict prevention and de-escalation, however small and indirect this
contribution may be.

The thesis addresses this research question across four individual articles and
contribute to the literature through substantial data collection[?], and novel
theory building, which breaks new ground on a so far `under-researched' part of
the larger peace- and conflict research. The thesis has contributed to two data
projects. The Anatomy of Resistance Campaigns (ARC) and the Geo-International
Systems Data (Geo-ISD). The ARC project collected yearly data on 1,426 organizations
engaging in maximalist dissent (non-violent and violent) in Africa from 1990 to
2015. The Geo-ISD geocodes the borders of independent states in Africa from
1800 to 1900, which are used to generate a measure of their respective
historical presence per 0.5 X 0.5 degrees grid cell. 

When historical state legacies are located far from the capital, they provide
\textit{symbols of sovereignty} that can be use to mobilize for violence, and
\textit{local elite networks} are often left behind and can mobilize their
networks if their interests are threatened by the government. While on the other
hand, when located near the capital, historical state legacies provide a
\textit{foundation} on which modern states could be built. Both in terms of
institutions and legitimacy.

The number of historical state legacies within a country matters because the
more of these there are, the more likely that one or more of them will be
located in a remote part of the country (and thus be conflict inducing).
Furthermore, increasing the number of potential claims making actors
incentivises the government to punish (engage in conflict) groups it would
otherwise accommodate in order to prevent other groups to make similar demands.

Whereas local elite networks might have incentives to violently oppose the
government, they also have incentives to minimize the amount of violence
between local groups and communities. Just as the state does on a country
level, and just as historical states did in their time. Therefore, historical
state legacies provide local institutions and traditions of conflict
resolution, as well as build up trust between communities, which prevent
outbreaks and escalation of communal violence. Where little or no historical
state legacies exist, and the modern state is weak or absent, groups are limited
to less effective mechanisms (such as intra group policing) to keep the peace.
In other words, when it comes to \textit{communal violence} there is an inverse
relationship between historical state legacies and organized violence.

In summary, the thesis finds that the historical legacies of statehood's
relation to organized violence varies according to:\\

1) Where in the modern state the historical state legacies are located. More
historical state legacies being conflict inducing far from modern capitals, and
conflict reducing when close.\\

2) How many distinct historical state legacies there are within a country's 
boundaries. More distinct historical state legacies leading to more conflict.\\

3) Type of organized violence. While there is more state-based violence in areas
with historical more historical state legacies, there is less communal
violence.\\

\section{Existing literature} \label{Existing literature}
\subsection{Correlates of civil war and non-state conflicts} 
\label{Correlates of civil war and non-state conflicts}

\citep{Hegre2001} ` intermediate regimes are most prone to civil war, even when
they have had time to stabilize from a regime change. In the long run, since
intermediate regimes are less stable than autocracies, which in turn are less
stable than democracies'

*** Non-state scraps *** 
Relative to the civil conflict literature the literature on non-state violence
is still in its infancy. Nevertheless, works have examined subjects ranging from
electoral violence \citep{Fjelde_2020, Salehyan_2014, Burchard_2015}, to rebel
on rebel violence \citep{Fjelde_2012, Lilja_2011, Cunningham_2012, Nygard_2014}
and refugees \citep{Bohmelt_2018}. More closely relate to this thesis is the
literature that has examined communal violence.

 Communal violence is organized lethal violence between identity groups. These
 groups can identify along tribal, national, clan, religious, ethnic lines, or
 any other source of identity, but are not permanently organized for combat, in
 other words not rebel groups, formally organized militias or state coercive
 apparatus. A key difference between communal conflicts and civil conflicts is
 that both parties are, at least nominally/in a de jure sense\footnote{Gray
	 areas include areas outside de facto state control, or cases where one
 side acts with government impunity or backing.}, subject to the higher
 authority of the government. For further discussion of the concept of communal
 conflict see \citet{BroscheJohan2012Cccw}. While events that trigger such
 conflicts can be often be relatively minor (theft, trespassing, illegal
 grazing etc.) this type of violence tends to quickly spiral through reprisals
 and counter reprisals and can rack up large death tolls and often far larger
 displacement \citep{Horowitz_2001}. The quantitative literature has focused on
 structural causes that makes conflict more likely to trigger. In particular
 climate and environmental factors have been shown to increase rates of
communal violence \citep{Turner_2011}. Both negative \citep{Detges_2017,
Fjelde2012, van_Weezel_2019, Petrova_2022} and positive \citep{Theisen2012,
Witsenburg2012} shocks to livelihood related to precipitation. Others have
pointed to socioeconomic inequality \citep{Fjelde2014, PETERS_2004}, mixed legal
systems \citep{Eck2014}, marginalisation and corruption \citep{BENJAMINSEN_2009}
or state-building on pastoral lands \citep{hagmann2008pastoral}.
\subsection{Historical legacies} \label{Historical legacies}

The literature on the long term effects of past statehood can broadly be
separated into the economic and political outcomes, which I will briefly
summarise below, and conflict outcomes, which I will cover in Section
\ref{Theoretical/conceptual framework}.

Some more on the violent pre-state past? Similarities between this violence and
communal violence.

\subsubsection{Economic legacies} \label{Economic legacies}

How states are composed today clearly matter for economic development, levels of
violence and a host of other things, but a [major/pivotal] argument of this
thesis, and a emerging literature, is that \textit{past} states matter as well.
On every continent there are hundreds of states, than until relatively recently
were independent and sovereign entities, much like the those who survived until
today. Many, if not most, of them were amalgamated into larger states through
the process of colonisation.\footnote{The two major exceptions are the
unification of Germany and Italy.} There is a growing literature demonstrating
how these past states and institutions still have lasting legacies today. Most
of this literature has examined the effects of past statehood
\citep{Bockstette2002, Borcan2018} and institutions related to statehood
\citep{Michalopoulos2013, Michalopoulos2018, Englebert2000} and largely agree on
a positive effect of statehood and institutions \citep{Nunn_2020,
Michalopoulos2016}, although there are notable exceptions \citep{Acemoglu_2002}.

\citep{Grosjean_2011, Mazzuca_2021}

\subsubsection{Political legacies} \label{Political legacies}

A different branch of research has examined political implications of
state legacies. \citet{Acemoglu_2002} argues that European colonialism lead to a
`reversal  of fortunes' for the areas it affected. Poorer areas with less
population density (areas less likely to be at the center of states), were less
likely to be colonised early, `deeply', and with European settlers (in part
because of states more effectively resisting colonization). This lead to a
larger transfer of European institutional innovations, and consequently a
reversal of economic development \citep{Acemoglu_2002}. Building on this
research, \citet{Hariri2012} test parts of the proposed mechanism and finds that
more pre-colonial experience of statehood decreased the likelihood of being
colonised, while it increased the likelihood of only being \textit{indirectly}
colonised. Furthermore, not being colonised, or being so indirectly, depresses
post-colonial democracy \citep{Hariri2012}. On the other hand, through a number
of case studies Wilfahrt \citeyear{Wilfahrt2018, Wilfahrt_2021} has documented
how areas and groups with pre-colonial experiences of statehood are better at
distributing public goods equitably and efficiently, and are generally more
likely to adopt [non-partisan (non-group based)] legislation and politics. The
actors themselves ascribe this to their history of cooperation (under the
umbrella of pre-colonial states). This is even true in Senegal, the poster child
of French direct rule and dismantling of pre-existing institutions
\citep{Wilfahrt_2021}.

\subsubsection{Legacies of violence and contention} 
\label{Legacies of violence and contention}

This limited statehood has been linked to a number of empirical outcomes. For
example, \citet{Alesina2011} uses `squigglyness' of international boundaries as
a measure/instrument for whether the boundaries were drawn with local knowledge
(endogenously), or not (exogenously). They find that straightness of
international boundaries, what they term artificial borders, are linked with
lower levels of economic development. The presumed mechanism (which is not
tested) is that artificial borders, borders drawn by an exogenous process, group
together multiple ethnic groups and split others. These ethnic constellations
then make it difficult for the state to create a sense of nationhood and get
people to work toward common goals. \citet{Englebert2002} tests this more
explicitly and find that states whose borders split ethnic groups more, are more
often involved in international disputes. They also find that countries whose
boundaries group together ethnic groups with more different forms pre-colonial
political organization\footnote{As measured by the standard deviation of
\citet{Murdock1967}'s jurisdictional hierarchy index.}, are more susceptible to
civil wars, political instability and secession attempts. Following
\citet{Englebert2002} the conflict-literature has also uncovered links between
ethnic partitioning and civil conflict \citep{Ito2020}, as well as links between
resulting trans-border ethnic kin relations and conflict \citep{Cederman2013,
Salehyan2009, Weidmann2015}. [Tie back to (limited) degrees of statehood]

\subsection{Moving beyond the literature} \label{Moving beyond}
% Filling the gaps, addressing the puzzles

\section{Concepts} \label{Concepts}
% Concepts and literature

\subsection{States} \label{States}

At the core of the thesis lies the concept of `the state'. However, the term is
ambiguous. Three of the four individual articles in the thesis use a specific
operationalisation, derived from \citet{Butcher2019} and \citet{Butcher2017},
but the concept merits further discussion than what the article format allows.
The subject of the thesis requires a definition that is broad enough to include
African and Asian states in the nineteenth century and modern European states.
It needs to be flexible to the changes in how we think of the state across time
(even in Europe, states were very different from today), as well as across
space. While at the same time it needs to draw the line at some point to say
what is not a state. To this end the thesis employs \citet{Clapham1996}'s three
aspect of the state, which allows assessing degrees of statehood along three
axes.

The first aspect of the state is the \textit{administrative}. The ideal of
which is an organization (government) which exercises sovereign jurisdiction
(the final legal arbiter) over a given population and territory. To exercise
this sovereignty the government controls a coercive apparatus (military and
police forces), which is usually financed by taxing the population. In return,
modern states are usually expected to ensure the welfare of its
citizens/population (externalities, health, security, education etc.). A state
in this sense may be more or less able to control its population, and more or
less able/willing to provide welfare.

The second aspect of the state is the `idea of the state', as constructed in
the minds of at least those who run it, but usually also a portion of the
population living within a state. This construction provides legitimacy for its
institutions and its use of coercive force (governmental legitimacy), and for
who, or where it should rule (territorial legitimacy). Today most states draw
their governmental legitimacy, their right to rule, from claiming (more or less
truthfully) to rule on behalf its citizens through democratic
principles.\footnote{Even the most blatant autocracies make this claim. [cite
Fukuyama?]} Historically, various forms of religious justification has been the
norm (divine right of kings in Europe, the mandate of Heaven in China, or rulers
claiming to be gods or dependents of gods themselves [what's the legitimation
for caliphs and amirs?]). Claims to territorial legitimacy (or lack thereof)
usually rests on a mix of historical precedence and the principle of national
self determination. Past claims include, rights to inheritance, religiously
based rights to world conquest, or the infamous `white mans burden'. The
`idea of the state' and legitimacy is key to ensuring compliance with minimal
use (or threat) of coercion. [Reference Buzan and others in this section]

The third aspect of the state is the system of international recognition. States
recognising each other, and respecting (or even protecting) each others
sovereign territories. In the current globalized world, international
recognition has become essential to participate in international transactions.
States that are lacking in the first and second aspects of statehood can lean
more on the international system, through aid (both from other states but also
non-state actors) and ideology. Prior to the twentieth century, multiple
international state systems existed. Even as late as the nineteenth century what
mattered to most Muslim rulers was recognition by the Caliph in Istanbul, not
what the kings or queens of Europe considered had to say on the matter.
Similarly in East Asia China (the Middle Kingdom) was at the center of its
tributary-based international system, while South East Asia was organized in the
Mandala state system [Northedge and others?].

States can conform to each of these three aspects to a greater or lesser extent.
In other words, states have an overall degree of statehood, but also a
qualitative variation in terms of the individual aspects. [Poor performance] in
one aspect can be compensated, but only in part by strong performance in other.
Taiwan for example, has a robust and well functioning state apparatus, and is de
facto in undisputed control of its territory, enjoys a high degree of legitimacy
and [compliance] from its citizens, but struggles with a lack of full
international recognition. Israel has a [strong] administrative statehood, and
enjoys recognition from the most relevant actors (the exception being several
Muslim majority countries), but is viewed as largely illegitimate among many of
its Palestinian population [fair assumption?] (roughly 20\% of its population).
Somalia (and other so-called `failed states') [score] poorly across all three
aspects of statehood. The Somali government barely functions in and around the
capital, let alone the rest of its [purported] territory. Its government is
viewed as corrupt and illegitimate. Its borders do not reflect the settlement of
the Somali ethnic group, lacks any historic president, and are the product of
exogenous factors (external diplomatic negotiations). What little claim to
statehood Somalia has rests almost exclusively on the international system.
[Link to artificiality here?]

[Relevance of state creation/formation/building. Contrasting the `natural'
process with the artificial? Or is that going too deep?] 

Because this thesis is concerned with differences between state composition
relative to the local histories of statehood, I need to discuss how these
compositions can come about. I separate between endogenous forms of state
formation and exogenous forms of state formation. Relative to the three aspects
of state endogenous state formation relies on administrative state capacity and
the idea of the state, while exogenous forms of state formation relies almost
exclusively on the international system of states.

\citet{scott2017against} Against the grain - state formation - a look at how
states first emerged

Vast majority were non-state until at least 1600. -Frontiers Most of the history
of the state is about its interactions (trading and raiding) with the
`barbarians' beyond its frontiers. Stable, lasting states are rare outside, and
prior to, the Westphalian state system (Egypt, China and Rome are notable
exceptions). The default is a perilous existence, where states rise, thrive and
fall in rapid succession. Ending at the hand of other states, barbarian
invasions, population exodus or any combination of the above. The arrival of
gunpowder is the game changer. Led to a period of state `building' or stating in
Africa (and elsewhere?) prior to the arrival of European colonialists [Source on
this?]. For many states, or parts of the world, this was still the reality in
the nineteenth century. As described by	\citet{Scott2009}. States ruling an
agrarian core surrounded by a large, permeable frontier. State penetration into
the frontier was in the from of relations with groups, ranging from tributary,
through allied or hostile to extracting `protection' payments from the state.
The point of this discussion [which should be made clear earlier, or perhaps
means that this belongs elsewhere] is that drawing a line on a map between what
is and is not part of a state, or what areas belong to what state, prior to the
globalisation of the Wesphalian model allowed for a great deal of variation in
the frontier zone, based on what ones conceptualisation of statehood. A more
accurate representation would be shade/gradient of statehood that fades into the
frontier, for most of Africa and Asia in the nineteenth century. Boundaries
between states, when they occurred, would usually be in the frontiers of each
state, where neither would have full control.

The extent of states then, would vary according to their ability to project
military power outside their alluvial/grain producing core(s). This, in turn
rested on their administrative and `idea of state' aspects of statehood, as the
limited and often local systems of statehood had limited influence.
\citet{Clapham1996}'s argument is that post-independence Africa represents a new
model of statehood, where statehood rested almost exclusively on the
international system. They were in large part created by (large and important
wars of liberation/de-colonization notwithstanding) and eventually sustained by
the international system. At the very least their \textit{extent} was. This
amounted to a novel form of limited, or artificial statehood. I argue that this
process is not unique to Africa. In Asia too, Europeans created colonial states,
and left countries with limited degrees of administrative statehood and vague
`ideas of state'.

\subsubsection{Historical state entities and pre-colonial states} 
\label{Historical state entities and Pre-colonial states}

At this point a further clarification of the terms `past states',
`pre-colonial states', and `historical state entities' (the term used in the
second article of the thesis) is needed, as these terms are used more or less
interchangeably in this [introductory chapter/narrative]. The reason they are
used interchangeably is that they do refer to the same \textit{concept}.
However, they [apply to/are used in] different \textit{contexts}. Specifically,
I use `pre-colonial states' in the context of Africa, where the majority of
states were at some point colonies. The other two terms are used in the global
context and refers to states that now form parts of sovereign states. The latter
refers is further restricted to the time period of the second article of the
thesis (1816-1939).

\subsection{Maximalist dissent and organized violence}
\label{Maximalist dissent and organized violence}

% Remove Maximalist dissent? Helps with cohesion in general, but makes fitting
% paper 1 harder

Another key [aspect] of the thesis is collective action; people cooperating in a
more or less organised fashion, to a achieve more or less common goals. [Add bit
about how all forms need to overcome the collective action problem?]
Specifically, this thesis is concerned with two [types/different
conceptualizations] of collective action, namely \textit{maximalist dissent} and
\textit{organized violence}.

\citet{OlsonMancur1965TLoC} and \citet{Tullock_1971}
emphasise the difficulty of overcoming the barriers to collective violent action
and the free rider problem.

\subsubsection{Maximalist dissent} \label{Maximalist dissent}

Tarrow 1998, `power in movement is cumulative'

A central concept in the first article of the thesis is maximalist dissent. The
concept builds on \citet{TillyCharles1978Fmtr}'s definition of collective
dissent as observable action involving multiple people, beyond normal
institutional procedures for realizing political goals. This could include
anything from strikes, sit-ins, shirking, large scale demonstrations and other
non-violent tactics, to riots, terrorism or armed rebellion. It does not include
acts of dissent executed in an individual capacity, acts that lack clear
political goals and acts within institutional political bounds (regular
functioning of political parties, lobbying, electoral participation etc.). The
second part of the concept, maximalist, refers to the political goals of the act
(event). The definition builds on the criteria used by the NAVCO 1 data set,
which only includes resistance campaigns where the objective was maximalist
(i.e. regime change, secession, or self-determination) as opposed to limited
(i.e. greater civil liberties or economic rights) [cite online appendix of
NAVCO]. The ARC data (presented in article 1) clarifies this further as demands
that calls for changes in the political structure that would significantly alter
the executive’s access to state power, the rules with which executives are
selected, or the policy or geographic areas for which the executive has the
right to make laws \citep{Butcher_2022}.

While the remaining articles of the thesis are concerned with organized
violence, most of which represent the violent specter of maximalist dissent
(more on this below), the literature on the non-violent form of dissent has
[informed] the thesis in a number of ways as well. Understanding how, and when,
nonviolent forms of dissent work and when they do not can help us understand
when and why people choose to pick up arms and use violence. There is general
agreement in the literature that nonviolent dissent (or resistance) is the most
effective of achieving maximalist political goals \citep{chenoweth2011civil,
Stephan_2008} such as regime change and democratization \citep{Celestino_2013,
Bethke_2019}. Why then do some actors still chose violence? Part of the answer
could be the size of the target audience \citep{Gleditsch_2021}. Groups whose
goals appeal to a large part of the population (such as overthrowing an
unpopular autocratic regime) find the mass mobilization that is necessary for
nonviolence to be successful easier that groups who appeal to more narrow bases
(such as self determination for minorities)\citep{Gleditsch_2021}. Economic
structures could matter as well \citep{Butcher_2014}. A substantial literature
is also arguing that repression of nonviolent campaigns or protests, can cause
escalations to violence, although there is conflicting evidence
\citep{Chenoweth_2017, Lichbach_1987}.

Furthermore, a key reason for employing the term maximalist dissent is that
there is no sharp dividing line between violent and nonviolent forms of dissent.
In her study of the civil war in El Salvador \citet{Wood2003} highlights how
rebel groups cooperate and work closely with civil society, and how individual
rebels shift between violent and nonviolent forms of dissent. Many predominantly
nonviolent movements have violent wings, who increase the likelihood of
violent escalation -- especially if the nonviolent campaign fails to make
progress \citep{Ryckman_2019}.

\subsubsection{Organized violence}
\label{Organized violence}

There are many forms of organized violence, most of which are captured by
maximalist dissent. I follow the UCDP and \citet{Melander_2016} in treating
organized violence as the aggregation of the mutually exclusive typologies of
one-sided, non-state and state-based violence. One-sided violence is violence
committed by formally organised non-state groups or governments against unarmed
civilians. State based is what one usually thinks of as armed conflict, or
simply war. More accurately, it is armed conflict where at least one side is a
government (and the other is not unarmed civilians). This includes inter state
conflicts (conflict between states), extrastate conflict
(decolonization-conflicts), intrastate conflicts (conflicts within states, i.e.
civil conflicts) and internationalised internal conflicts (intrastate conflicts
in which at least one party receives troops from another state). Non-state
violence is violence perpetrated by named organizations (criminal organizations,
political parties, rebel groups etc.) or identity groups (ethnic or religious
groups), against one another (without the involvement of government). Non-state
violence therefore is seldom driven maximalist dissent, although clashes between
political parties or politicised ethnic groups could be potential borderline
cases.

This thesis focuses on three forms of organized violence: intrastate,
internationalised internal conflict (hereafter referred to collectively as civil
conflict) and communal violence.\footnote{Historical state entities could matter
	for interstate conflict. For instance in cases where the borders of
	historical state entities cross international boundaries, old borders
	could form the basis of claims making and disputes, such as with the
	borders of the former empire of Bornu \citep{Hariri2012}. However, as in
	the case of Bornu, such disputes can be solved peacefully in
	international courts. Additionally, three of the four papers rely on an
	African sample and the continent have seen only one interstate conflict
and no extrastate conflicts in the time period covered in the papers.}

\section{Theoretical/conceptual framework}
\label{Theoretical/conceptual framework}

\subsection{Models} \label{Models}

\subsubsection{Grievance} \label{Grievance}

There is a substantial literature explaining the occurrence (and re-occurrence)
of civil conflict. This literature can be traced back to a handful of classic
studies in the 1960s and 1970s. \citet{GurrTedRobert1970Wmr}'s theory of
relative deprivation and the related `revolution of rising expectations'
\citep{Davies_1962} focused on how widespread individual discontent laid the
ground for revolution. This grievance and deprivation focus was later applied to
structural inequalities as well \citep{Muller_1985, Muller_1987,
ScottJamesC1977TMEo}. 

The response to this criticism was to shift to meso/group level mechanisms,
moving away from strict Marxist/materialist explanations at class or country
level. For example, \citet{Hechter_1978} argued there was a cultural division of
labor, and that civil conflict occurred when cultural and economic groups
coincide. Others emphasized competition between ethnic groups for scarce
resources \citep{barth1969}. \citet{Horowitz1985}'s case studies demonstrated
how ethnic groups can garner intense feelings of belonging, collective
self-esteem and group worth, and that ethnic conflict was not just competition
for scares resources, but \textit{also} for political influence. He anticipated
the literature on horizontal inequality by stressing the role of cognitive
comparisons between groups as a mechanism for ethnic conflict. Despite the scale
of Horowitz's study, there was still a lack systematic empirical support for the
idea that grievances (group level or not) could lead to civil conflict. The
drive to address this gap was lead by Gurr and the minorities at risk (MAR)
project \citet{GurrTedRobert1993Mar:}. In response to Tilly's earlier
critique he also added some opportunity to the general argument of grievance in
the resulting work \citep{Gurr_1993}. 

Responding to this \citet{Kalyvas2006} and others turned to radical
disaggregation in an effort to tighten the logic of causal inference. Examining
the role of interpersonal grudges and local score settling in civil violence
\citep{Kalyvas2006, Kalyvas_2008}, moral outrage at government injustice and a
sense of doing the right thing \citep{Wood2003}. Reflecting earlier work by
\citet{barth1969}, others expressed scepticism of the [use of] ethnic identities
in civil conflict research. They argued that ethnic defection is more common
than previously assumed \citep{Kalyvas_2008, Staniland_2012}, and that ethnic
identities are essentially undetectable and or too fluid \citep{Gilley_2004,
Chandra2006}. Commonly used measures in the quantitative literature on ethnicity
and civil conflict like ethnic fractionalization \citep{Alesina2003,
Posner2004} and polarisation \citep{Montalvo2005} also had the issue that 
blind. The state is not ethnically neutral \citep{CedermanLars-Erik2013Igac}.
Using data from the Ethnic Power Relations (EPR hereafter) project
\citet{CedermanLars-Erik2013Igac} and building on previous quantitative efforts
\citep{Gurr_1993, Goldstone_2010} were finally able to put grievances on a solid
empirical footing. They found that horizontal ethnic grievances
increases the likelihood of conflict \citep{CedermanLars-Erik2013Igac}. [a bit

\subsubsection{Opportunities} \label{Opportunities}

The emphasis placed on grievances was not without critics. Charles Tilly and
others questioned the lack of empirical support of grievance based arguments
\citep{Oberschall_1978, Brush_1996}. Specifically there seemed to be a
discrepancy between the proliferation of grievances and relative rare events of
civil conflict \citep{Snyder_1972, TillyCharles1978Fmtr, Skocpol_1979}. 

Seemingly unaware of the existing critiques \citet{Collier2004} explicitly frame
their paper around the `Greed versus grievance' debate, and forcefully reiterate
the previous argument that if grievances caused civil war, then there would be
civil war everywhere. Instead they painted a picture of civil conflict being
driven by cynical and greedy conflict entrepreneurs, backed by a solid, albeit
over simplified (see below), systematic empirical investigation. By the time
they revisited their initial article the picture had become more nuanced, using
the term opportunities in the place of greed \citep{Collier2009}. Yet, the
fundamental argument and criticism of the grievance motivated literature
remained largely unchanged. Also [taking the side of] opportunities
\citet{Fearon2003} emphasized how fighting in peripheries, rough terrain, state
weakness and corruption due to oil evened the odds in favor of rebel groups.
Like \citet{Collier2009} \citet{Fearon_2004} nuanced their initial stance in
their follow up work on civil conflict duration, echoing
\citet{WeinerMyron1978SotS} `Sons of the soil', they argued that concentrated
peripheral ethnic groups react violently to perceived incursions.

\citet{Weinstein_2005} natural resources provide opportunities for short term
rewards, while in poor surroundings rebel leaders must make credible promises of
future rewards based on political reform.

\subsubsection{Bargaining} \label{Bargaining}

The likes of \citet{Fearon1995} and \citet{Powell2006} introduced bargaining
theory to international relations. \citet{WalterBarbaraF2002CtPT, Walter2006,
Walter2009} and \citet{Cunningham2006, Cunningham2013c, Cunningham_2013} brought
it to civil conflict.

\citep{Buhaug2009, Cunningham2006, Cunningham2013c, Cunningham_2013, Walter2006,
Walter2009}

\citet{Denny2014} Unifies all! Ethnic groups are likely to have grievances, are
better able to organize (opportunity) and are more likely to face bargaining
issues.

\subsection{The conditional [effects] of historical statehood}
\label{The conditional [effects] of historical statehood}

The theoretical goal of this thesis is to examine connection(s) between the two
overarching concepts of past states and organized violence. To this end, I turn
no to the question of what links have already been found between the two, and
what is this thesis adding to this literature? 

Main `thrust' is that `it depends'. Expand on the answer to the puzzle in the
introduction. It depends on the relationship between the modern state and old
state(s), and on the type of violence.
