\section{Introduction}

In North West Indonesia 1976, GAM (Gerkan Aceh Merdeka: Free Aceh Movement)
declared independence for the province of Aceh, under the leadership of Hasan di
Tiro, a descendent of the last Sultan of the Aceh region. Initially the movement
consisted of the remnants of an old religious network, with its roots in the old
Sultanate and armed struggle against the Dutch. The resulting
conflict lasted until 2005 and resulted in an estimated 3402 combat related
fatalities after 1989 \citep{Aspinall2009, Pettersson2018, Sundberg2013}.

In Ethiopia 1975, the Dirge regime tried to arrest the Sultan of Aussa. However,
anticipating the move, the Sultan's son had already sent men to neighboring
Somalia to train in guerilla warfare \citep{Shehim1985}. The Sultan evaded
arrest and launched the Afar Liberation Front (ALF) organized around the men
trained in Somalia. The heavy handed response of the Ethiopian military left
over a thousand civilian casualties (https://ucdp.uu.se/conflict/363).

In 1960, in the newly formed Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville) (current
Democratic Republic of the Congo) South Kasai declares unilaterally to have
seceded from the nascent Republic under the leadership of traditional chief
Albert Kalonji \citep{Nzongola2002}. He then preceded to have his father
declared the new Mulopwe, thus resurrecting the royal title of the Luba kingdom
(1585-1889). His father promptly abdicated handing the title to Kalonji (now
styling himself Albert Ditunga, `homeland'). South Kasai fought for independence
for just over two years, provoking a campaign by the Congolese armed forces that
at the time was characterized by UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld as an act
of genocide \citep{Nzongola2002}.

\textbf{Why is this problem worth addressing?} \\
\textit{How does it relate to other work? Puzzles etc in the literature.}

What the three preceding narratives have in common is that in both the media and
the academic peace-and-conflict literature, they have been cast almost
exclusively as ethnic conflicts. While all of them do have important ethnic
components as well, they clearly demonstrate a link to past states. While there
is a growing literature on the economic consequences of state histories, only a
handful of studies have examined the link between past statehood and organized
violence. However, the findings in this emerging literature have been
conflicting so far. While some, in line with the examples given above, find a
conflict inducing effect of past states \citep{Englebert2002, Paine2019}, others
argue that past experience of statehood provides experience and institutions
that are peace inducing \citep{Wig2016, Wig2018, Depetris-Chauvin2016}.
Additionally, this literature has been almost exclusively focused on Africa.
Thus there are open questions as to whether there is a positive or negative
association between state histories and organized violence, or if both
statements are true, but vary according to circumstances. In case of the latter,
what determines the instances when and where past statehood is conflict inducing
or peace inducing.

\textbf{What do I do to address the problem/puzzle?}

How is organized violence shaped by the underlying topography of historical
statehood? This thesis seeks to answering this overarching research question,
adding to our general understanding of organized violence. While increasing the
general understanding of key concepts is a goal in itself for any academic
discipline, this understanding will hopefully contribute to the vital goals of
conflict prevention and de-escalation, however small and indirect this
contribution may be.

I address this research question across four individual articles and contribute
to the literature through substantial data collection[?], and novel theory
building, which breaks new ground on a so far ``under-researched" part of the
larger peace- and conflict research. The thesis has contributed to two data
projects. The Anatomy of Resistance Campaigns (ARC) and the Geo-International
Systems Data (Geo-ISD). ~Brief summaries.
