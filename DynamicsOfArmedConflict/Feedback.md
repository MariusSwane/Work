## Other comments 

I think the course could have benefited from spending a bit more time in the
beginning to define and discuss the core concepts of 'mechanisms' and
'dynamics'. For someone coming in with a very different understanding of those
concepts I only really understood (fully) what was meant after the third day.

Lastly, of course I think the course would have been even better in person.
