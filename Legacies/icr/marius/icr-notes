Turning on geometry checks

Dungurhpur part of Baroda I am unsure to include or not.

Both Baroda and "Staaten von Gudjerat" are on the map.

Some uncertainty around the Bundela states which do not have names other than
capitals.

Cochin kingdom should surely be included?

Unsure about Maratha/Satara

Sukadana kingdom in Qviller2000a

Korea/Qing

Vietnam/Dai Viet

Southern border of Siam in Qviller2000a

Riau/Johore in Qviller2000a

Cachar? Between Manipur and Assam in Qviller2000a

Mughal code?

Persia and greater Persia? Relates top China/Korea and the Ottoman empire

Balkh?

Cyprus and Agean Isles?

Buganda and Busoga have the same COW-code

Marawi?

Kakonda? 

========

how many states

avg errors

how many points to georeference?

Ratio between errors and points suggests most of you should be using fewer
points (which is good news!)

Core/periphery

Ask, what was difficult? ways to improve? what did you spend a lot of time on?

Are we asking the same questions

Districts, should we code them?

Malay, Hausa, Sikh and Mossi stateS

Old citys in Bellin, update to the usual suspects?

Gold coast, and other name problem

Johor and Riau-johor

Bellin, wrong parts should stay wrong!
