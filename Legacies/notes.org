* Questions for weekly meetings

- Mamprussi is in Ghana. Kari-Anne has adopted it. Do we edit the candidates
  file? It should probably get a new COWNUM? And should it not be ISDID and
  ISDNUM? It is only based on COW but we apply changes, and extend.

- Tenkodo gets incorporated into Ouagadougou by the French. Is this indirect
  rule? Yes! For a very short period.

TODO: Add coding instructions for ethno/national variable in the codebook.

* Notes from weekly meetings

- When states are fully indipendent we code "not applicable" -9.
