Meeting with CB
===============

PhD
---

1. What to do about Kristian?
	He is alive! 
	- Email to night.
2. How does the spellchecking editing work?
	- Copy editor. Talk to Ingrid.

Legacies
--------

1. Short ones are OK, but...
2. Way more time saving to not copy everything from the ISD v2 manually.
3. I still think area is a waist of resources. I would rather have
   *centralization* or *dominant ethnic group*.
	- Checking with the others:
		- Should we pre-fill codesheets based on ISD?
		- How often do you come across what the dominant ethnic
		  group/nationality of a state was? Should we add this as a
		  variable?
4. I do Burkina Faso.

Other
-----

I could not even access that paper, much less find the data. Seems the authors
are from an economics background...
