# Catch up and Plan

- Sensitivity test on glm-nb?
    - It's fine to do it on sqrt transformed model
- Getting back to OneDrive
- Paper idea: state survival

## For Trondheim:

- Have a look at the Asia maps for culling
- Talk about who does what with the data

## In general

- Post processing of the mapping
    - Wrong cow code, make it reproducible (do it in R)
    - Faulty polygons
- Comb and sample Asia
