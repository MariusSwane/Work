# New Abstract notes

## Question
* Do more hosting HSE's cause cause conflict?

## Contribution
* New and arguably better data
	- Geographical scope
	- Coverage of states
* This data allows us to contribute to the growing literature on the link between
ethnic, groups historical states and conflict.
* We also contribute to the existing literature on artificial states.

## Conclusion
* Our robustly show that the number of HSE's in a country is positively
associated with having experienced more conflict onsets in the post WW2 period.
