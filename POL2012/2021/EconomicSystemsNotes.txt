7 Dimensions of economy and society

- Economic system 
- Characterized by what?

- Economic system **primarily** decentralized to market interactions supervised
by the state
- Minimum requirements of the state?
	- Property rights, rules/regulations (addressing externalities), umpire/arbiter,
	non-market economy
- Ideology, it rests on a belief in the system

- Private ownership of the means of production, markets for labour, capital,
land and goods, a distinctive role for the state, legitimizing ideologies, and
an expansionary tendency.

Examples?
---------

- USA
- Norway? - WHY NOT? DISCUSS! 
	- social democratic, centralised wage-negotiations (labour market not
	just market based), violates property rights for redistribution
- China? 
	- "State capitalism", geographically mixed, state owned run as private
	for de facto profit, these companies are favored politically
- Somalia? 
	- The libertarian laissez-faire dream state! 
	- REMEMBER SOMALIA!

- Socialism/communism? 
	- Politically it has been an unmitigated disaster
	- Economically? It has some merits 
	- Command economy, that is...
- Mixed? 
	- This is a major theme throughout the rest of the course.
