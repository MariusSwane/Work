Economic systems
================

1. Give 5 examples of economic systems.

Capitalist, communist/socialist, facist, state-capitalist, slave-based,
agrarian, collonial/extractive, plantation, feudal

2. Find an **academic** article online (google scholar, oria or equivalent is
   helpful), and summarize some of its theoretical arguments.

Classical political economy
===========================

1. Explain the reigning theory of value in classical political economy.

Goods have value **in** exchange based **on** labor. In a long run equilibrium
the price will tend toward its natural price. Think of this as an *innate*
value.

2.
	* What are the marginal opportunity costs of planes and in this
	  beautifully drawn example?
	
	Ger: 50p or 1000c, cost of 1p = 100c/5p = 20c
	Swe: 2p or 800c, cost of 1p = 800c/2p = 400c

	* What are their respective comparative advantages?

	  Lowest opportunitiy cost!

	  Ger: Planes (absolute advantage in both) 
	  Swe: Cars

	* What (if anything) should each of them specialize in according to
	  Ricardoâ€™s theory of comparative advantages, and why? Demonstrate and
	  explain! What terms of trade benefits both countries?

	Ger: p = 20c, c = 5/100 = 0.05p in internal market
	Swe: p = 400c, c = 2/800 = 0.002p in internal market

	They should specialize according to their comparative advantage. Any
	trade in the range of 1 (German built) plane for 21-399 Volvos.  
	
3. Why is growth slowed down by rents over time according to a Ricardian view?

Bringing more real estate into the system increases the value of the real
estate. This allows the landlord to raise the rent, the payment of which will
have to come out of either wages of capital. Growth = capital accumulation, and
because wages can never go below subsistence level (for long), profits (i.e.
growth) gets squeezed between rents and wages. Poor capitalists...
