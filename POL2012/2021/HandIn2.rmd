Neo-classical political economy
===============================

1) Use neo-classical marginal analysis to draw a model of, and explain, a shift
in supply.

2) Draw an approximate indifference curve for a consumer who:
	a) Loves apples, but dislikes oranges
	b) Loves apples and oranges just the same

3) What does it mean that the demand for a good is inelastic at a given price?
When is it elastic?

Marxism
=======

1) What separates Marx' labor theory of value from earlier classical theories of
value?

2) According to Marx, why will capitalist economies be doomed to repeated
economic crises?
