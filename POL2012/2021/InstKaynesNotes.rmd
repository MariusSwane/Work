Intro
-----

- Survey > reference students
- Topics for second half

Historical context
------------------

- First half of 20th century
- Corporate power
- Trade Unions
- The State

Institutionalism
----------------

- Can be a bit difficult, less clear cut and fewer "heroes", more particularist
  theories/models
- Critique of the reductionism of neo-classical PE
- Evolution not Equilibrium
- Institutions and Power
- Bringing the "Political" back into "Political Economy"
- Critique of Capitalism % Reform > Revolution

Theory of the Leisure class (1899)
----------------------------------

- Conspicuous consumption/leisure % Consumption is socially determined (taken as given in neo-classical)
- The Social process of production % Workmanship and predatory instinct, NOT PART of the theory of the leisure class!

John Kenneth Galbraith (1908-2006)
----------------------------------

- Power
	- Condign power (coercion,punishment)(leadership)	
	- Compensatory power (money)(ownership/property)	
	- Conditioned power ("soft power")(oraganisation)
- Technology 
	- Increasing pace -> requires planning -> growth of corporate power	
	- At odds with planning and corporations
	- Planned economy for private corporate good?
- The techostructure
	- Ownership != control 
	- Control of Information	
	- Corporate growth > profit
- Rise of the Corporations 
  	- Orkla group: KiMS, Nidar, OLW, Stabburet, SÃ¦tre, Pierre Robert
	- Corporations operate in oligopolistic structure (AT ODDS WITH NEOCLASSICAL) 
	- Only small businesses approach perfect competition 
	- Consumer is NOT king (BECAUSE OF CORPORATE POWER)	
	- Corporations decide the products	
	- Creates needs, consumerism 

Corporate Globalization
-----------------------

- TNC's/MNC's 
	- Largest 500 70% of global trade
	- intra-corporate trade, 1/3 of trade?
	  How do you think the market operates in these circumstances?	
	- less susceptible to national market forces and governments
- Consumers and workers? 
	- cheaper goods, less variety, jobs are mobile - workers are not
	- Everything is global... including economic crises
- Shifting balance of power 
	- Mobile institutions > localized
- The State 
  	- Counterbalance 	
	- still limited to market failure

John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946)
-------------------------------

- Father of modern macroeconomics

The Great Depression
--------------------

- Crisis of demand
- Wages are not flexible - But, that is not the problem!
- Vicious Cycle 
  	- Wages down -> demand down -> more people unemployed 
	-> demand further down -> even more people unemployed 
	-> NO Equilibrium!

Keynes' solution
----------------

- Y=C+I+G+X-M
- Step 1: Be the state
- Step 2: Increase aggregate demand % (Un)Employment is key
  	- Increase Spending % Fiscal policy
  	- Cut taxes (less inflationary, but...) % Dynamic effects
  	- The multiplier effect
- Inflation 
  	- Increases in fiscal policy leads to inflation, 
	  if employment is high you should limit inflation (countercyclical)
- Monetary policy 
  	- increase money supply -> interest rates down 
	  -> demand up (but usually controlled by central bank)

Pre-Keynesians?
---------------

- FDR's New deal
- Stalin
- Hitler

Discussion
----------

- What would a neo-classical analysis of the Great Depression look like? 
  	- Unemployment -> wages dropping -> profits rising -> 
	  employers hire more workers -> unemployment is eliminated
	- Unemployment as self-prescribed. 
	- Stay out! 
	- Bust unions if necessary!
