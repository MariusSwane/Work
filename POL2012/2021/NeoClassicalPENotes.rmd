Neo-Classical 	
---------------

- We still need at least one reference student
- Neo-classical !- neo-liberal

Historical context - A crisis of capitalism
-------------------------------------------

- 1870s ->
- Social upheaval (Glorious Revolution and first republic in Spain, Paris
  Commune etc)
- Marxism/socialism
- Economic depressions
- Imperialism
- Natural sciences & positivism
- Utilitarianism

Supply and Demand
-----------------

- LÃ©on Walras (1834-1910) supply and demand interacts to form an equilibrium
  (general equilibrium theory)
- William Stanley Jevons (1835-82); Carl Menger (1840-1921) (Formalized into
  marginal analysis)
- Alfred Marshall (1842-1924) (Formalized further and synthesized)

Assumptions
-----------

- Utility - Explains differences and maximization % Value, Smith
- Rational actors
- Information and competition

Benefits
--------

- Proofs
- (formal) Models - much science!
- Predictions - actually super useful
  - Orthodoxy for a reason - bread and butter of economics as a field of study
    to this day
- With strong/assumptions come great power! BUT!
  - With great power comes great responsibility - Understanding that these are
    very simplified models. The assumptions will never strictly hold, and som
    the results will reflect that.

Units of analysis
----------------

- Consumers - Utility maximizing, rational, sovereign and in charge
- Firms - Profit maximizing.  Output given by Marginal cost = marginal revenue.
  No more need for "winging it" when it comes to output. 
   - slave to the consumer
   - slave to competitions
     - But are they really? - Constantly dooing everything in their power to
       avoid competition! Create/inflate demand, differentiate products.
       - Simultaneously "proves" and disproves the theory!
- No room for class or society as a whole only "aggregate" 
  - To what degree can individuals be aggregated?

How should we structure the market?
-----------------------------------

- Perfect competition! - Pareto efficient use of factors of production!
  Eliminates excess profits! Everyone is happy!

- Easier said than done?
  - Breaking monopolies? - Can undermine incentives, international competition,
    how monopolized before breaking up?
  - Barrier to entry can be really stubborn in a world of technology and
    patents.
  - Short term? 
  - Long term? - Inheritance

Distribution
------------

- Labor market is still a market - S&D - it will form an efficient equilibrium!
  Don't worry about it! 
  - Interfering might impair efficiency of the market!
- Distribution is a result of ability

Similarities
------------

- Capitalist markets economy
- Pursuit of ``governing laws"
- Equilibrium
- Private property % Competition and self interest. Without property there are no profits
- Economic liberalism

Differences
-----------

- Neo-classical is far less holistic % Economics included history, geography, politics, institutions, social sciences in general. Concerns of social progress.
- "Physics envy"
- Far less moral conserns, but not devoid of it: liberal-interventionist
