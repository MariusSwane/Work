## Trade your way out!

- What can "we" do?
- What should "the bottom billion"" do?
  - Stop subsidizing and liberalize trade
  - Quit aid
  - Diversify Exports

## Globalization is Colliers Answer, but...

<p class="fragment">
<q> "The problem is how to get firms over that initial hump of competitiveness and enable them to get on the escalator [of productivity growth]"</q>

```{r}

```

## Acemoglu & Robinson

- Inclusive or extractive institutions

## How best achieve growth?
- Let's check in with our other paradigms

## <font color="black">My man Francis</font> {data-background="img/francis.jpg"}

- What paradigm is this?
- Are American institutions in Decay?

## Is Eternal growth possible?

## Crystal ball
- 1980s -> Neoliberal economic and political order replacing a Keynesian order
- 2008 the end of the neoliberal political economy?
	- Doesn't look like it: finance regrouped (too big to fail)
- 2016 the end ot the neoliberal political economy?
	- Brexit, Trump, populism
