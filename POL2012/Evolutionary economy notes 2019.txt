The Other Cannon
- What we have covered so far
- Parallell evolution of tradition
- Cunfusing but there are familiar faces (traditions not mutually exclusive/porous borders)

How have countries grown historically?
- The central question
- Country or Regional level
- Historical analysis
	But not materialist, historisist or (typically dialectic)

Schumpeter (institutionalist or evolutionary economist?)
- Structural change % Through technological and institutional innovation
- Creative destruction
	- Innovation!

But does it explain the whole picture? Real (controlled for inflation) wages

What matters to Reinert is real wages not production growth 
- Economic (production) growth? Yes, but progress?
- Two stories explain this graph, Socialist or QEA 

Quality of ecnonomic activity p.317
- Focus on production, not exhcange
- Moving up the value-chain
	- Example drugs/medicine vs. plastic toys (today)
	- Limited/imperfect competition & barriers to entry -> profit
	- Dependent on human capital -> real wage growth
	- Technological synergies
	- Increasing returns
    
	- Toys
	- neo-classic market competition -> limited profits
	- unskilled labor -> real wage stagnation or worse
	- few(er) synergies
	- diminishing returns

Trade and production % I just told you that is Prod. not exch. so...
- Sequecing % Very common argument
- List quote
% Rejects Ricardo, but only a different emphasis than Smith
    
% Theory! By protecting nascent market you can increase its competitiveness relative 
to other markets (both domestically and internationally), 
once it has caught up with the international market it can compete without protection. 
Embrace free trade, and push it on others (pulling up the ladder).

Tariff example

- Tool to climb the ladder % Protect and strenghthen the manufacturing industries
- More on this next week (globalization)

Studwell
- Shining example of evolutionary economy
- Climbing the latter in 1,2,3
	1. Land reform. High yield household farming - The capitalist lab
	2. Manufacturing focus anchored in export dicipline
	3. Financial repression and manipulation to these ends ("The merits of a short leash") 


Shortcomings?
	- Deterministic and mechanistic? 
		- Cycles of 50-60 years succeeding each other
	- Predictive power?
		- Better as a description of the past than a guide to the future?
		- Identifying past waves. Future waves harder…!
	- Assumes that technological progress just continue
		- Just accidents in history? n = 5? 6? Robert Gordon
	- Not nearly as formal and analytic as neoclassical economics
