Collier, what is he?
NC: 2
Evo: 4

NC because he focuses on obsticles to be removed. Growth is default state
- conflict is massive scewing of market
- landlocked is only a problem because of government barriers to trade (bad neigbors
- bad governance (gov intervention?)
- Resources is the exception that fits with evo

## The financial crisis, recession and stagnation

## Real Estate bubble
- Home prices up 60%, 2000-2006
- Subprime loans
- Securitization - do you know what this means?
- Crisis goes global

## Why? - discuss
- Marxists: nevitable consequence of the system. Capitalists seeking profits but
 the rates of profits are getting ever smaller! This also explains why the crisis became so big.
- Keynesians: Not relevant 
- Institutionalist: Lack of regulation! Investment bank subject to less oversight than
 regular banks and who polices the police? (insurance)
- Neoclassics: Government policies encouraging home ownership, Fed too low interest rates
 (until sudden increase) + increasing housing prices + other technicalities (market to market
 accounting). Wesbury (a bit on the extreme).

## Response
- Massive injections into the market by the Fed, the ECB and the Bank of England - KAYNES!
- Expansionary monetary policy -> low interest-rates.
*This is where the similarities end*
- United States continued stimulus in the range of $800 billion
- ECB turned to fiscal discipline
  - Sovreign debt

## The problem of diversity
- What is appropriate for Germany may not be appropriate for certain other EU countries
- And vice-versa
- The United States has this problem too!
- BUT, its easier to get Americans to bail out fellow Americans

## And who did better?
*Pretty samey*

## We need to talk about Greece

## Lacy Greeks or Austerity
## Some perspectives
- Piketty: "Germany has never repaid its debts. It has no right to lecture Greece."
  - Two ways to repay debt:
    - Strict budgetary discipline over 100 years
    - Inflation, tax on private wealth, debt relief
- Krugman: Eliminating deficits during a crisis is a recipe for depression. Leave the Euro.
- Ferguson: Clean slate makes no sense if the problem is structural (see Fukuyama ch6 for account of some of Greece's structural problems).

## Greeceland
% Krugman might have a point!
% But, did Iceland really escape austerity? Imports did not catch up to pre-crisis levels until 2017.
 Selvsufficient in anluminium and fish...

## Lenders of last resort
- IMF, World Bank, ECB (Germany)
    - If not these then who?  % EU economy or already high inflation
    - Moral hazard % Ferguson


## Europe going the way of Japan?
 - No growth, no inflation, negative interest rates
