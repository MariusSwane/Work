## The Global Financial Crisis

## Real Estate bubble
- Home prices up 60%, 2000-2006
- Subprime loans
- Securitization

## Not a New Phenomenon

## Why?
- Schumpeterians: Financial crises linked to long economic waves. 
- Marxists: Capitalism creates financial crises
- Keynesians: Financial crises occur when we don’t regulate capitalism
- Neoclassics: Government involement creates artificial markets and inefficiencies

## Asian Financial Crisis; systemic problems 
- Banking systems still underdeveloped (Borrow money more cheaply abroad)
- Foreign loans
    - What if there is a devaluation…?
- Quasi-contractual relationships between political and economic elites
     - Moral hazard
- Dollar peg
      - Dollar appreciates -> local currencies appreciate

## Asian Financial Crisis; Shit Hits the Fan
- Moral hazard -> Bad Loans
    - Real estate bubble
    - Insolvent banks and financial institutions
- Dollar peg
  - Appreciating dollar -> Overvalued local currencies -> Speculative attacks
- Massive outflows of capital
  - Foreign exchange reserves drained
  - From fixed to float, depreciations
** Aside
- Need larger stocks of foreign reserves
- Run current account surpluses!
- Keep undervalued currency
- Invest current account surplus in US debt!
-> US money supply up -> US interest rates down -> Cheap credit -> Housing bubble

## Response
- Massive injections into the market by the Fed, the ECB and the Bank of England
- Expansionary monetary policy -> low interest-rates.
*This is where the similarities end*
- United States continued stimulus in the range of $800 billion
- ECB turned to fiscal discipline
  - Sovreign debt

## The problem of diversity
- What is appropriate for Germany may not be appropriate for certain other EU countries
- And vice-versa
- The United States has this problem too!
- BUT, its easier to get Americans to bail out fellow Americans

## And who did better?
*Pretty samey*

## We need to talk about Greece

## Lacy Greeks or Austerity
## Some perspectives
- Piketty: "Germany has never repaid its debts. It has no right to lecture Greece."
  - Two ways to repay debt:
    - Strict budgetary discipline over 100 years
    - Inflation, tax on private wealth, debt relief
- Krugman: Eliminating deficits during a crisis is a recipe for depression. Leave the Euro.
- Ferguson: Clean slate makes no sense if the problem is structural (see Fukuyama ch6 for account of some of Greece's structural problems).

## Ferguson has Opinions

## Do we even need monetary systems?
- Facilitates international transactions
- Makes trade easier and more predictable
- To avoid financial crises… 
- Crypto-currency?

## Europe going the way of Japan?
 - No growth, no inflation, negative interest rates
 - A crisis of production and inovation?

## Solutions?
- Schumpeterian medicine
	- Spending focused on long-term opportunities
	- Human capital, innovation
	- Removal of vested interests
