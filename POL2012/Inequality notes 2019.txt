- Inequality
One of The topics of the day
US: 1% of the people 25% of the income; 1% of the people 40% of the wealth

##Inequality of what?
- Gender?
- Opportunity?
- Social?
- Wealth?
- Income?

Last two - Economic inequality

##
- Not a zero sum game! The important bit: the robbers gain = your loss!
- The economy (thankfully) does not work like this. Tends to be winners all around, but some win more
- Can you think of some examples where the economy DOES work as a zero sum game?

- Two broad trends lead to the same effect (Wealth Inequality)
- Every one is getting richer - some started with more
- The rich are getting richer faster than the rest

- Inequality is not poverty! (they are related, and we will return to that later)


## Let's look at the data

- Graphs galore
	- United States is not THAT cracy
	- China is... (in terms of change)
- World numbers are simillar, check out:
- World Inequality Data (Piketty)

- But poverty IS going down
- Remember: EXTREME poverty, barely surviving, is the default human condition!


## What are the consequences? 

% AKA why should we care?

% Remember your paradigms!
%     Marx: continued/worsening oppression of the working class
%     Institutionalist: money is power, power can be used to skew markets & politics -> growth! From meritocracy to plutocracy?
%     Neo-classical: should not affect equality of opportunity! -> growth, but trying to correct can also be problematic
%     Keynes? not relevant
%     Evo: social upheaval/revolution, Protest parties and democratic degeneration, Erodes social cohesion, reduces trust and legitimacy

% Health? Social inequality

## Causes?  % Now that we care
- Marx: capital accumulation & class system, exploitation of labor
- Neo-classical: reflects ability or accumulated ability (inheritance)
- Keynes? not relevant
- Institutionalist: money is power, power has been used to skew markets & politics
- evo: Long run tendency (Marx right?)


## Piketty
- r>g 
	-> income from rents increase more than income from wages (which depend on growth)
	-> wealth inequality over time

- Goes(2016): Observed increases in income inequality largely uncorrelated with changes in r – g.
- Acemoglu & Robinson (2015): Institutions!
    - r > g not unimportant (does lead to more inequality), but many other variables quantitatively 
	more important
- Stiglitz: Two forms of capital 
	- One which increases productivity, one which is captured economic rent
		- Former is good, latter is bad.
		- Financial capital reduces productive capital

##Soulutions? 

- Progressive taxation (DEFINE)
	- Walter Scheidel 2017 says this has NEVER worked, only mitigated
	- Piketty says this is most of the reduction of the world wars, but that only those wars 
	made the policies politically viable
- Public tax records? Worked for Norway, will it work for Trump?
- Global cooperation (closing tax havens)
- Focus on reducing poverty instead?
