After reading Stillwell
1. What is Institutional Economics?
- A Motley Crew (less clear boundaries)
- Critique of reductionism
- Focus on Institutions and power
- Bringing the "Political" back into Political Economy
	- Social Science
	- State back in
	- Normative judgements
	- Evolutionary
	- Pros: less removed from the Real World
	- Cons: Analytically far less clear
- Critique of Capitalism

2. Is it a brid? Is it a plane? No! It's the Historical Context!
- First half of 20th century
- Corporate Power
	- "Robber barons"
- Trade Unions
- The State

3. Thorstein Veblen (1857-1929)
- Theory of the leisure class (1899)
	- Social nature of production
	- Unproductive consumption

4. John Kenneth Galbraith (1908-2006)
- Power
	- Condign power (coercion,punishment)(leadership)
	- Compensatory power (money)(ownership/property)
	- Conditioned power ("soft power")(oraganisation)
- Technology
	- Increasing pace -> requires planning -> growth of corporate power
	- At odds with planning and corporations
- Ownership is not control
- Rise of the Corporate manager
	- Control of Information
	- Corporate growth > profit
- Corporations operate in oligopolistic structure (AT ODDS WITH NEOCLASSICAL)
	- Only small businesses approach perfect competition
- Consumer is NOT king (BECAUSE OF CORPORATE POWER)
	- Corporations decide the products
	- Creates needs, consumerism
- His MODEL is illustrated on p.237.

5. Corporate Globalization
- TNC's/MNC's
	- Largest 500 70% of global trade
	- intra-corporate trade, 1/3 of trade? How do you think the market operates in these circumstances?
	- less susceptable to national market forces and governments
- Consumers and workers? cheaper goods, less variety, jobs are mobile - workers are not
- Everything is global... including economic crises
- Shifting Balance of Power
	- mobile institutions > localized
	- IMF, WB, WTO uphold the system
- Galbraith: the State
	- Counterbalance
	- still limited to market failure
6. Reform > Revolution
- Result? Influence?
	- The state has been heavily involved in the successes of a number of countries
	- The welfare state
	- There is no such thing as pure free-market economics
	- However, in countries where the state has been extremely heavily involved (aka Communism),
	 the result has been failure.
	- Good institutions has been the mantra of every social scientist for the past 20 year
	 as the key to economic growth.
