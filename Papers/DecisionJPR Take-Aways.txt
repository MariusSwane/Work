1. "Dead" states might be overly "tabloid", creating some confusion.

2. Add even more on defining "state". And separate more clearly the difference
between regime and state, and clarify that we do not count different regimes.

3. Try a model with some sort of weights by how recent the states were. Some
sort of "half-life" weight.

4. Add even more on why we consider borders almost exogenous for most countries,
and emphasize that for the rest it should bias against our hypothesis (i.e. we 
follow a conservative approach of including "problematic" countries).

I get the feeling that this was Scott's main issue.

5. Can we go further back without comparing apples to oranges (in terms of
sources)?

6. How to avoid the problem of "You should do what you do in your other paper".

7. Add a measure of whether there has been some continuity of a state in the
country (easier for some countries than others).
