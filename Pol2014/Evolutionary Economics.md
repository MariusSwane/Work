Trade and Production
====================

*"I saw clearly that free competition between two nations which are highly
civilised can only be mutually beneficial in case both of them are in a nearly
equal position of industrial development, and that any nation which owing to
misfortunes is behind others in industry, commerce, and navigation .. must
first of all strenghten her own individual powers, in order to fit herself to
enter into free competition with more advanced nations."* - **Fredrich List 
(1841)**
