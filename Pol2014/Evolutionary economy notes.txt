Seminar 1
	Did you pass?
Stuff you missed (we need to freshen up a bit)
	- Paradigm, Theory and Model
	- "unit of analysis"
Evolitionary Economy (EX-Phil time!)
	- Plato vs Aristotle
	- Epistemology, rationalism vs empiricism
How have countries grown historically?
	- Types of growth
		- Smithian
			- Trade, division of labor
		- Solovian (neo-clasish, orthodox)
			- Investment based
			- GDP = LKA
Structural change (technology)
	- Schumpeter (institutionalist or evolutionary economist?)
		- Creative destruction
		- Innovation!
	- But does it explain the whole picture? Real (controlled for inflation) wages
What matters to Reinert - real wages more important than growth? - quality of ecnonomic activity
	- Focus on production, not exhcange
		- Moving up the value-chain
		- Entry barriers
	- Pause for a moment and think of theory
Neo-classical/orthodox vs Evolutionary

Trade and production (Reinert)
	- Free trade is a rich mans game
	- First you get your production going throu manufacturing behing barriers, then 
	you start to export, and climb the ladder of the value chain
	- Only then do you liberalize
	- The developed world keeping the rest down by free trade?
Studwell
- Shining example of evolutionary economy
- But, also of its shortcomings, more on that next week
	- Deterministic and mechanistic? 
		- Cycles of 50-60 years succeeding each other
	- Predictive power?
		- Better as a description of the past than a guide to the future?
		- Identifying past waves. Future waves harder…!
	- Assumes that technological progress just continue
		- Just accidents in history? n = 5? 6? Robert Gordon
	- Not nearly as formal and analytic as neoclassical economics



- Climbing the latter in 1,2,3
	1. Land reform. High yield household farming - The capitalist lab
	2. Manufacturing focus anchored in export dicipline
