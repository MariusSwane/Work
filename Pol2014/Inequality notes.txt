Welcome! How was last weeks lecture with Espen?

Next week, the lecture will be on TUESDAY (10:15) room D3 with Morten Jerven

- Inequality
One of The topics of the day
US: 1% of the people 25% of the income; 1% of the people 40% of the wealth

##Inequality of what?
- Social is not economic 
- is not income
- is not wealth (primary focus)
- etc

- Every term paper on inequality I've graded so far got this wrong to some extent

##American Inequality
- High, but relatively stable
- Numbers are from Pikettys project, and do not include financial assests
- Top 10%, mid 40-90%

##Chinese Inequality
- Far more dramatic increase

##Not a zero sum game! The important bit: the robbers gain = your loss!
- The economy (thankfully) does not work like this. Tends to be winners all around, but some win more
- Can you think of some examples where the economy DOES work as a zero sum game?

- Two broad trends lead to the same effect (Wealth Inequality)
- Every one is getting richer - some started with more
- The rich are getting richer faster than the rest

- The rich are not getting richer by making the rest poorer!

## What are the consequences? pose to class! 

Does it matter that some are getting richer faster when (practically) no one is getting worse off?
- Decrease in economic growth? - Market (or other [compensatory]) power can cause distortion!
- Social mobility? 
    - From meritocracy to plutocracy? 
- Protest parties and democratic degeneration 
- Health?
- Riots? Revolution? 
- Erodes social cohesion, reduces trust and legitimacy

## Causes?
- Piketty: r>g -> income from rents increase more than income from wages (which depend on growth)
	-> wealth inequality over time

- Can you think of any other possible causes?

- Long run tendency?
- Globalization? Worldwide marketplace - Winners are big winners, losers are big losers…
	- Race to the bottom
- Financial bubble?
- Politics?

## Politics
- Taxes until the late 1970s were much higher 
- Race to the bottom?
- Manipulation of the financial system
     - Enabled by regulations lobbied for by the financial sector

## Response to Piketty
- Goes(2016): Observed increases in income inequality largely uncorrelated with changes in r – g.
- Acemoglu & Robinson (2015): Institutions!
    - r > g not unimportant (does lead to more inequality), but many other variables quantitatively 
	more important
- Stiglitz: Two forms of capital 
	- One which increases productivity, one which is captured economic rent
		- Former is good, latter is bad.
		- Financial capital reduces productive capital

##Soulutions? - What do you think?
- Great levelers?

## Soulutions?
- Progressive taxation (DEFINE)
	- Walter Scheidel says this has NEVER worked, only mitigated
	- Piketty says this is most of the reduction of the world wars, but that only those wars 
	made the policies politically viable
    - Public tax records? 
- Global cooperation

-OR... accept the status quo, as long as people are coming out of poverty and no one is losing?

- People ARE coming out of poverty!

- Poverty is the default historical state of the vast majority of the population! Be grateful!
