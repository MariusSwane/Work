1. John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946)
- The grand old man of 20th c economics
- A coherent, rigid school of economics
- A Treatise on Money (1930)
- The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (1936)

2. Context
- Liberal democracy (including capitalism) under pressure
- World Wars, Facism, Communism, Protectionism, Great Depression

3. Unemployment
- Its bad! Underutilizing resources, government income reduced, social problem.
- Neoclassical economics: No unemployment
Unemployment -> wages dropping -> profits rising -> employers hire more workers 
-> unemployment is eliminated
	- Unemployment as self-prescribed.
- The Great Crash (and subsequent Depression)

4. The Great Crash
- Neo: Stay out! Bust unions if necessary!
- Marx: Revolution!
- Keynes: Active fiscal policy

5. Crisis of Demand
- vicious Cycle: Wages down -> demand down -> more people unemployed 
-> demand further down -> even more people unemployed -> NO Equilibrium

6. Keynes Solution
- Y = C + I + G + X - M
- National inclome = Consumption + Investment + Governemnt expenditure + eXports - iMports
- Multiplier: positive cylcle
	- But inflation
	- Spending or Tax-cuts?
- Monetary policy:
	Increasing money supply->interest rates down->investments up, consumption up, demand up
