Practical matters:
- The Hand-infolder is live
- Data/Stata/R/Youtube
- Reference Students (put contact info up on blackboard) 

1. Karl Marx - Framework for understanding Capitalism
- Capitalism emerges from feudalism (which in turn emerges from slavery - primitive)
- Mode of Production
- Internal dynamics and Contradictions
- Evolutionary, and revolutionary (prescriptive)
- Resurgent?

2. Historical Context
- Rousseau (influence/foundation)
- Structural changes: "business was booming"
	- From merchants to manufacturers
	- From landowners to industrialists
	- But for the workers? Malthus
		- Wages stagnant
		- Work-days long (14-18h)
		- Low-skill industries
		- Factories, mines
	- Even authorities worried
		- Bad soldiers
		- Revolutionary potential
3. Method of Marx
- (bad(Popper)) Historical (Hegel)
- Materialist
- Dialectic (empire-barabarians, aristocracy-bourgeoisie, bourgeois democracy-proletariat->communism)
- Praxis

4. Criticism of Capitalism
- Lack of class understanding
	- Focus on capital vs. labor
	- Separation of labor from the ownership of the means of production
		- One class has the ownership of the means of production
		- One class survives by selling its labor power

- Exploitation (labor THEORY of value) builds on Smith
	- Any situation where one class derives income from the labor of another class
	- Produce value over and above what is returned to them
		- Surplus value (profit)
		- Shareholders, managers, supervisors, etc.
		- Banks, financial institutions
		- Government
	- Wages: Determined by class struggle
		- Lots of actors interest in minimizing wages and maximizing surplus value
- Growth of monopoly power
	- Accumulation of capital the driving force of capitalism
	- Expansionary nature of capitalism
		- Imperialism (Lenin)
- Uneven development (Only one class benefits, and also imperialism)
- Commodification
- Alienation from fruits of labor
- State serves capitalist interests
- Capitalism can not provide social change (selfperpetuating)
- Economic Crises
	- Falling profit rates
	(value is only created by labor) Total surplus value increases,
	but if less labor is used relativ to capital, the RATE of profits fall.
	Ever more capital intensive.
	- Underconsumption (overproduction)
	- Lack of a coordinating actor
5. Curb your Enthusiasm (for Revolution)
- Is capitalism bad?
	- Highly progressive system
	- A huge step forward
	- But no social progress in capitalism
- Capitalists are not evil
	- As good or evil as any other human being…
	- Capitalist behavior stems from the structure.
	- Cannot behave in any other way
	- Exploitation is systemic/structural
	- Conflict of interest is structurally embedded in the system
	- Marxist level of analysis: Structural – doesn’t matter if individuals are good or evil
	- Neoclassical level of analysis: Micro/individual or meso/firm
		- Not structural. No program for structural change (or any other change)
		- At the same time: Taking structure for granted, just adapting to it.
6. But what of Growth? 5 conditions of capital accumulation
- Minimizing production costs
	- Extending the geographical area
	- Hiring people from new social groups at lower wage rates
	- Unemployment
- Increasing surplus value
	- Pushing production costs down
	- Increasing the volume and value of goods and services
	- Raising the productivity of labor
	- Raising the intensity of labor
	- Mechanizing production
- Realizing surplus value
	- Marketing the products – commercialization of life
	- Grow consumer demand
	- Extend credit facilities
- Capitalism very good at this!
	- Social institutions that underpin/legitimize the system
	- Coercive backup
	- Micro level action by actors pursuing their own self-interest. Very adaptable!
		- But only within certain limits? 
- (Rapid circulation & economic and social reproduction)
7. Thomas Piketty (1971- )
- Modern Marxist (keep this in mind as you are reading)
	- Why does his work/theory fit inside the framework?
		- History
		- Structures
		- Criticism of flaws inherent in Capitalism
		- Class
	- However...
		- Equations, and lots of noeclassical modelling
		- Gone is the Dialectic
		- Gone is the Praxis (mostly)
