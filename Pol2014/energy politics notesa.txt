# The political economy of Energy
Energy IS NOT electricity 
	- Different sources for different uses
        - Fossil fuels
        - Renewable and non-renewable 
    - Technology-economics-politics
    - Energy and politics
    - Energy and growth % The importance of vested interests


# International politics
- Big money


- Not just big money % Germany 40% of gas from Russia #choke
    % Dams are kind-of like this as well
    - Energy security


# Discuss the statement:
"Energy dependence is a source of conflict"

# Climate change

Current global energy supply

What needs to happen?
- Change the type of energy used 
- Change source of electricity % most electricity is still produced by coal, gas second
- How do they interact? % # Thanks Marshall!

\section{The Green Shift}

# {Market mechanisms} 
- Make renewable energy competitive 
    - Carbon taxes and ETS
(Taxes depress the economy)

# Alternatives to the market?

% Short of revolution, this is pretty much what we got
% Fiat is an option, but seems even more unlikely

# Will it work? % ARGUMENTS!


# Potential problems
- Vested interests 
- Energy systems are built around fossil fuels 
- Energy efficiency 
    % Energy efficiency is an alternative to structural/system change
    % Cost effective, make a plane use less fuel > make an electric plane
    % Good, but not enough?
- Only works if our assumptions hold 

% What is the cheapest source of energy? Clean/not-clean?

# Electicity prices

# Discuss Norway and wind?
