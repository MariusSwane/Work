<h4>
- Two broad trends lead to the same effect
- Every one is getting richer - some started with more

</h4></font>

     - Enabled by regulations lobbied for by the financial sector

##<font color="white">Response to Piketty {data-background="img/piketty.jpg"}
- Goes(2016): Observed increases in income inequality largely uncorrelated with changes in r > g.
- Acemoglu & Robinson (2015): Institutions!
    - r > g not unimportant (does lead to more inequality), but many other variables quantitatively more important
- Stiglitz: Two forms of capital
</font>

##<font color="white">Response from Piketty {data-background="img/piketty.jpg"}
- Institutions ARE important. 
- r > g is important no matter what
- Data indicates that only wars and revolutions have mitigated wealth concentration. 
- This is a problem no matter what!
