* Workshop at PRIO 2022

** Youth bulges as an instrument - Kristian & Mauricio

Mobilization still matters.

** â€œPower personalization and specialists in violence in dictatorships"

Why do only *some* dictators create parallel institutions of violence?

** What happens to women after civil resistance campaigns?

Under what conditions do legislatures become a source of instability?
    - When legislative exclusion *reinforces* exsisting ethnoreligious cleavages
      1. Relative deprevation (if there is no legislature, then "everyone" is
         excluded)
      2. Increased repression (the regime can be selective, and increase the
         repression of excluded groups)
      3. Fewer alternatives for peaceful dissent

** Chris grant proposal

Page 4 was lovely! Graphviz? dot? tikz packages

** Feedback on my paper

Try different resolutions! If the mechanism works on lower resolution, then that
is better.

Chris suggested voronoi-shapes, but they run into post-treatment bias issues

Interact with triggers identified in the litterature, for example environmental
shocks. This allows us to use panel analysis!
