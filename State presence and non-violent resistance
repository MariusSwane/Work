Do areas of high state precence see better organized contentious politics?
That is, is there more non-violent contention (perhaps relative to violent contention) in areas with `thick' state precence?
Or is the non-violent contention better organized?
This could be measured by whether contention happens through organizations (share of events covered by ARC), or by the type of organizations (from ARC) who are active in the contention.
