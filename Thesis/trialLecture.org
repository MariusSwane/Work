*** Political economy (trajectory) (unless I suddenly have time)

* I will conclude

* Descriptives (VIZ)

* Nathan Nunn on long term effects of Atlantic slave trade (VIZ)
** Not just West Africa, 3 other trades (cross Sahara, Red Sea and Indian ocean)
** 12 million + 6 million
*** Manning (1990) estimates that by 1850 Afrika's population was only half of what it could have been.
*** Iron/gun - slave cycle
*** May have led to increased ethnic fractionalization
*** Dissintegration/collapse of States
**** Primed for colonisation
**** Robbed of the benefits of large and more complex States (implications for development, Bockstette2002)
*** Abuse of legal systems to procure slaves
*** "Not universaly bad" Slaves were bought (someone profited), Slave raiding states (but struggled with transfare of power)
** Legacies of inter-ethnic emnities Inikori2000)

* Colonialism (VIZ)
** (Further) drop in the number of independent states (VIZ)
*** Only a partial restoration in the 60s, mostly new conglomerate states
**** Not a tabual rasa
*** Our paper, Englebert, Paine
** However, lot of ***polities***  survived (VIZ)
** The surprisingly light administrative imprint of colonialism (on the cheap)
*** Backing local actors (making them more despotic, Mamdani 1996)
**** Divide and rule
**** Sacrificing external sovereignty for greater influence/power over local population (in the short term)
*** At the national level western **ideas**  and opening of the world generates:
**** Nationalism
**** Pan Africanism
**** Socialism
**** Demands for democracy
*** Struggles for *** national** indepence
** Upon indepence national movements tend come to power
*** Tend to exclude collaborators with the previous regime (traditional leaders) at the national level
*** But PCS groups tend to come to power (Paine)
*** At the local level and in the peripheries traditional leaders retain influence
** Mixed covernance
*** Resurgence of traditional institutions at the constitutional level
** National institutions from respective colonisers
*** Degeree of indirect rule? Indirect, but subordinate in French system
**** Indirect rule scores bad on a number of metrics (Lange 2009) (democracy, beurocracy and state capacity)
*** Customary vs civil law
** Democracy (the only good thing to come out of colonialism?) (Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson)
*** States resisted western influence and protestant missionaries (education)(Hiribarean)

==============================================================================================================================
** Political economic trajectory (Robert Bates) (unclear indipendent variable)
*** The set up (industrialisation/modernisation)
**** Import equipment (pushed by colonisers)
**** Subsidising urbanisation (food, fuel and...)
**** Financed by raw material and crops exports and development loans. (export infrastructure from colonialism)
**** ... "taxing" farmers (most people) through monopsomies (established by colonial powers)
*** The fall (collapse in food prices 80s and 90s)
**** Sky rocketing dept (trade and budget defecits galore)
**** Industrialization went the way of Greece (Fukuyama)(not a case of "rampant" free trade, or unregulated capitalism)
*** The result
**** States on the brink of bancrupcy, large portions of national budget goes to servicing dept
**** Large, inefficient and often corrupt public sectors
**** Trapped in expensive (capital E) subsidy systems, that create black markets, curruption and smuggling.
**** Political instability and conflict
=========================================================================================================================

* Recap outcomes
** Slavery
*** Ethnic fractionalization -> conflict and retarded economic development
*** Redarded political development (with some exceptions) -> retarded economic development
*** Emnities between ethnic groups -> conflict, group based politics
** Colonialism
*** Conflict
*** Retarded economic development
*** (demand for/seeds of) Democracy
