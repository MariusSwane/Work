% The Effects of Slavery and Colonialism on Contemporary African Politics

% What I will cover

% Nathan Nunn on the effects of the Atlantic African slave trade
	% Not just Atlantic Africa, try to find some numbers on the East African
	% slave trade.

% Colonialism on the number of states, initial dead drop, only partial
% restoration in 60s -> our paper, Englebert and Paine, 
% BUT, lots of *polities* survived.
% Surprisingly light (institutional/administrative/manpower) imprint of
% colonialism. Strengthening the influence/prerogative/internal "power" of local
% rulers. (Why many were willing subjects). THIS has a big impact locally.
% Nationally, western *ideas* and the opening of the world is key, and in
% opposition to the development at the local level. Often excluding traditional
% leaders from power. Most/many regimes upon independence were led by the
% resistance to the colonial regime, of which traditional leaders were a key
% part. Resurgence of traditional leaders (reference Florians work)

% Institutions from their respective colonizers, some research on the outcomes
% of French and English systems in particular.

% Slavery all bad? Centralization of states
% Slaves where bought in Africa

% You might think colonialism changed everything!

% Result is a mix of traditional and western (colonialism is not a tabula rasa)

% Ideas of democracy or at least modernization along western lines. Efforts to
% industrialize based on importing equipment, subsidizing urban areas (food and
% fuel) by exporting raw materials and agricultural products (infrastructure in
% place from colonialism). Effective way of taxing population at low political
% cost and with minimal administration involved. Also massive loans. Everything
% collapsed in the 80s and 90s when food prices collapsed.
% Industrialisation/development projects were in large part ill conceived and
% their proximity to the political process and systems of subsidies, made for a
% system rife with corruption. "Neo-colonialism" and IMF/World Bank austerity is
% not to blame. If anything IMF/World Bank should probably have had/demanded
% even more control. All of this has of course led to the familiar political
% legacy of (1) African states on the brink of bankruptcy, spending considerable
% part of their budget to service dept, (2) governments being a surprisingly
% large (corrupt, and inefficient) part of the (official) economy, (3) expensive
% subsidy systems that create black markets and smuggling across boundaries.

% Impact on missionaries and stuff and DEMOCRACY

% Recap outcomes!
