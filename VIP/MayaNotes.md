# Alleging Terroris, Repressing Dissent
## Maiyoraa Jeyabrab

Figure 1; what do you mean "accounting for state repression"? Is it not just:
Nonviolent, violent and state repression events over time? And does it really
suggest that repression is targeting both violent and nonviolent events?

"In this article, I examine how government response towards nonviolent groups
changes as a result of activity from violent groups." - So, not looking at
outcomes? As suggested multiple times I feel. For example, "If this is true,
then we would see that states are less likely to concede...".

The paper relates to and contributes to the literature on the importance of
maintaining "nonviolent discipline".
