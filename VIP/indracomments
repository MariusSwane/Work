Pinker: interpersonal violence (homicide) fairly stable, supports your argument
about, variations in violence/homicide are determined by the variation in
organization. His explanation is of course that the need for organizing
decreases as the state monopolizes violence, civilizes and socializes its
population.

"Heavy regulation" creates opportunities for rents, but so does neighboring state
subsidising goods (usually fuel).
